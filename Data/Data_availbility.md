Our study uses raw data from studies conducted from the year 2000 until 2022 and thus did not generate new data. Wild meat consumption data were extracted from different published and unpublished sources as described in Extended Data Table 1. Due to the sensitive nature of the data (including illegal activities, such as the consumption of protected wildlife species), unprocessed datasets are available with restrictions through the WILDMEAT Data Portal (https://explorer.wildmeat.org/). Each dataset is available under different data sharing conditions through a Data User Agreement, which gives data users control over the distribution and use of their data. Requests to access the full, processed dataset used for analysis will be considered following permissions from original data providers.
